# Critique by Design

I chose to redesign a data visualization from Colleen Dilenschneider's arts management blog, *Know Your Own Bone*.

Overall, I thought this was a decent data visualization that could use a few adjustments to make it really effective. I thought the color scheme worked and the data labels make sense; however, the header was very busy and the title did not help reveal a story in the data.
