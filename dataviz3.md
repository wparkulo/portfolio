# Critique by Design

I chose to redesign a data visualization from Colleen Dilenschneider's arts management blog, *Know Your Own Bone*.

Overall, I thought this was a decent data visualization that could use a few adjustments to make it really effective. I thought the color scheme worked and the data labels make sense; however, the header was very busy and the title did not help reveal a story in the data. I also felt that this first data visualization was a little busy and that there may be a clearer way to focus in on the change between 2019 and 2020. 

With all this in mind I created my wireframe.

I got feedback on two friends about this first attempt.

--------------------------
I think it's really clear. I immediately understand that COVID-19 is a huge problem this year while it wasn't an issue last year. I'm just slightly unclear about the meaning of the X-axis Title | I honestly don't think I would change anything about your redesign! I like that you changed it to represent the differences so it's clearer what has changed over the past year.

I was really happythat my wire frame was clear to these two people because although they are friends, they are also aspiring arts managers who are the target audience of my data visualization. 

With their feedback, I created my re-design in Flourish. I adjusted the title of the X-axis to make it clear that it refers to the value of the barrier.
