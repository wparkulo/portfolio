# About Me
![Headshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73760381/100806081-d77d7d00-33fd-11eb-9e4e-9f7c3b2bfc09.jpg)

Hi everyone! My name is Wendy Parkulo (she/her) and I am a second year Master of Arts Management student. I am originially from Jacksonville, Florida and I went to undergrad at Flordia State University where I earned degrees in Theatre and Marketing. I am currently the marketing intern at Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. One silver lining of the pandemic for me is that I have had the chance to work at an amazing company in a different time zone while still taking classes at CMU. I hope to work in marketing or community engagement for a regional theatre company upon graduation. 


# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make compelling and informative data visualizations that will aid me in my career as a marketer. I do not have a ton of design or intense data analysis experience so I hope that this class can help me to improve both of these areas. Classes like this one are a big reason why I chose to come to CMU so I am really excited to dive in!
