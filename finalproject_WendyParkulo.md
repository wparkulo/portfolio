## Data
The data will come from the Actor's Equity Association, The Broadway League, and the U.S. Census Bureau.

The Actor's Equity Association Actors' was founded in 1913, is the U.S. labor union that represents more than 51,000 professional Actors and Stage Managers. The association conductd a diversity study from 2013-2015 and released their [findings](https://actorsequity.org/news/PR/First-EverDiversityStudy2017/) in 2017. The raw data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1QufPYWJQEc4naChpN77ATG-3bzDRwrpw7MvqhnD1WEA/pubhtml). I will use this data to highlight the gender and racial disparities in the Boadway industry. 

The Broadway League is the national trade association for the Broadway industry. The League publishes statistics about Broadway as a whole each year that can be found [here](https://www.broadwayleague.com/research/statistics-broadway-nyc/). I will use this data to underscore the Broadway industry's profits and provide information about the number of shows that were running during the aforementioned diversity study. 

I will use [New York City](census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork/POP010210#POP010210) census data to compare the demographics of the population of New York City to the demographics of the performers and stage managers with Equity contracts from the diversity study.
