# Final Project

# Part One

## Outline

### Summary
Theatre producers need to work harder to correct the racial disparities in the distribution and compensation of Broadway Equity contracts to meet the standards set out by the [We See You White American Theatre demands](https://www.weseeyouwat.com/). 

### Key Points
1. New York City is a diverse melting pot.

2. Broadway, not so much.

3. These racial disparities are coupled with income disparities too.

3. Broadway still has a long way to go to meet the We See You WAT demands.

4. Push Broadway producers to action by signing the We See You WAT petition. 

### Call to Action
Learn more about We See You White American Theatre and sign their [petition](https://www.weseeyouwat.com/) to demand change for BIPOC theatremakers. 

### Story Arc
I plan to start the story out positively by positively by talking about how diverse New York City is. Then, I will transition into how it is a shame that Broadway does not follow suit. I will continue to stoke discontent in Broadway's lack of diversity by explaining how there is also disparity in how much money different racial groups make. After that I will talk about how not all hope is lost because We See You White American Theatre is looking to make drastic changes to the industry. I will end on a high note by giving everyone a way to help by signing a petition to demand change for BIPOC theatremakers.

## Data
The data will come from the Actor's Equity Association, The Broadway League, and the U.S. Census Bureau.

The Actor's Equity Association Actors' was founded in 1913, is the U.S. labor union that represents more than 51,000 professional Actors and Stage Managers. The association conductd a diversity study from 2013-2015 and released their [findings](https://actorsequity.org/news/PR/First-EverDiversityStudy2017/) in 2017. The raw data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1QufPYWJQEc4naChpN77ATG-3bzDRwrpw7MvqhnD1WEA/pubhtml). I will use this data to highlight the racial disparities in the Boadway industry. 

The Broadway League is the national trade association for the Broadway industry. The League publishes statistics about Broadway as a whole each year that can be found [here](https://www.broadwayleague.com/research/statistics-broadway-nyc/). I will use this data to underscore the Broadway industry's profits and provide information about the number of shows that were running during the aforementioned diversity study. 

I will use [New York City](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork/POP010210#POP010210) census data to compare the demographics of the population of New York City to the demographics of the performers and stage managers with Equity contracts from the diversity study. I will also use [United States](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/POP010210#POP010210) census data to compare to the demographics of the entire country to those of New York City. 

## Method and Medium
I plan to build out my final project using Shorthand. I plan to create my data visualizations with Flourish. I am a big fan of Canva, so I may include a graphic or two that I design on that platform, as well. I will also incorporate copyright-free images from websties like Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash to make my presentation more visually appealing.

At the moment, for the final presentation, I plan to give a verbal high-level overview of my work while visually displaying my full final project Shorthand story.
